Hi there, I’m Michal
 
I’m a software test engineer currently working in [Kainos](https://kainos.com/).

This is yet another place in the internet with various software engineering stuff.

I try to write about things that I've worked on to save it for the future for myself.
I hope you will find it useful as well.

Views presented here are my own.
