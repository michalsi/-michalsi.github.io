Hi, I'm Michal. I'm a software test engineer currently working in [Kainos](https://www.kainos.com/)

Here I try to write about things that I have worked on. Subjects will touch software development and especially testing.

Material gathered here is primarily for me for the future as my memory is good - but short. Nevertheless I hope someone will benefit from it as well.


Views presented here are my own.
