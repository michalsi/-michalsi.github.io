Hi there, I’m Michał *(pronunciation is close to: `MEE-how`)*
 
I’m a software engineer currently working Quality Engineer in [Spartez](https://spartez.com/).

On this site I tend to keep things that I've been working on worked on. My main intention is to to save it for myself for the future.
But I hope some of it might be of use for someone else as well.

Enjoy!
